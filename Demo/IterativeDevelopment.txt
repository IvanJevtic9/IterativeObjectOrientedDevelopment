	Summary

Section1:

- In this opening module we have defined the requirements for a sample application
  Then, we have applied the principles of iterative development to implement the requirements

- You can rely on iterative development when implementing an algorithm
  or when implementing the straight-forward code all the same

- The idea behind it is that any development can be split into iterations
  and every iteration broken down into even smaller iterations
  The goal of the game is to reach such small, limited iterations
  that it takes only a line or two of code to implement them

- Every piece of code which is iteratively added to the code base is there to implement one tiny requirement
  As long as that requirement stays intact, the corresponding piece of code will remain correct

- Requirements rarely remain intact, They change over time
  New ones come, old ones change, evolve or disappear
  How will the code built with principles of iterative development in mind survive these changes?
  That remains to be seen, and that is precisely what we will be dealing with in the next module

- The goal of the module to come will be to figure the deficiencies of the current implementation
  to fix the issues and try to implement more customer’s requirements
